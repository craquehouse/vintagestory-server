Status: ready-for-dev

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As a {{role}},
I want {{action}},
so that {{benefit}}.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. [Add acceptance criteria from epics/PRD]

## Tasks / Subtasks

<!--
🚨 CRITICAL TASK STRUCTURE RULES:
1. Each functional task MUST include "+ tests" in its name
2. Do NOT create separate "Write tests" tasks at the end
3. A task is NOT complete until its tests pass
4. Tests verify the specific AC listed for that task

✅ CORRECT PATTERN:
- [ ] Task 1: Implement user login endpoint + tests (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Create login route handler
  - [ ] Add input validation
  - [ ] Write tests for success/failure cases

❌ WRONG PATTERN (tests batched at end):
- [ ] Task 1: Implement user login endpoint (AC: 1, 2)
- [ ] Task 2: Implement logout endpoint (AC: 3)
- [ ] Task 3: Write all tests  <- NEVER DO THIS
-->

- [ ] Task 1: [Description] + tests (AC: #)
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1: [Implementation detail]
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Write tests for [feature]
- [ ] Task 2: [Description] + tests (AC: #)
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: [Implementation detail]
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Write tests for [feature]

## Dev Notes

### Testing Requirements

**CRITICAL:** Tests must be written alongside implementation, not as a separate phase.

- Each task that adds functionality must include its tests before marking complete
- A task is NOT complete until tests pass
- Do not batch tests into a separate "Write tests" task at the end
- Run `just test` to verify all tests pass before marking task complete

### Security Requirements

**Follow patterns in `project-context.md` → Security Patterns section:**

- DEBUG mode gating for test/dev endpoints
- Timing-safe comparison for sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Never log sensitive data in plaintext
- Proxy-aware client IP logging
- RBAC patterns for endpoint protection

### Development Commands

Use `just` for all development tasks:
- `just test` - Run all tests
- `just check` - Full validation (lint + typecheck + test)
- `just lint` - Run all linters

### Architecture & Patterns

- Relevant architecture patterns and constraints
- Source tree components to touch

### Project Structure Notes

- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming)
- Detected conflicts or variances (with rationale)

### References

- `project-context.md` - Critical implementation rules and patterns
- Cite all technical details with source paths and sections, e.g. [Source: docs/<file>.md#Section]
