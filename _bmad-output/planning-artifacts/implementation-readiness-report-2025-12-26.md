## Summary and Recommendations

### Overall Readiness Status

# ✅ READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

### Assessment Summary

| Category | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Documents Complete | ✅ All 4 required documents present |
| PRD Quality | ✅ Complete with 39 FRs, 16 NFRs |
| Epic Coverage | ✅ 100% MVP coverage (38/38 FRs) |
| UX Alignment | ✅ Fully aligned |
| Epic Quality | ✅ No critical/major violations |
| Architecture | ✅ Implementation-ready with patterns |

### Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Action

**None.** All planning artifacts are complete and aligned.

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Run sprint-planning workflow** - Generate sprint-status.yaml to begin tracking implementation
2. **Start with Epic 1, Story 1.1** - Set up development environment using mise, uv, and bun as specified in Architecture
3. **Follow Architecture patterns exactly** - All AI agents should reference architecture.md for naming conventions, project structure, and implementation patterns

### Strengths Identified

- **Strong PRD→Epic traceability** - FR Coverage Map explicitly maps every requirement
- **Technology consistency** - All documents reference identical stack (React 19.2, FastAPI, shadcn/ui, xterm.js)
- **Clear architectural boundaries** - Service layers, API patterns, and state management well-defined
- **Comprehensive UX specification** - Component strategies and interaction patterns documented

### Final Note

This assessment identified **0 critical issues** and **1 minor concern** across 5 validation categories. The project is well-planned and ready for implementation. All artifacts demonstrate strong alignment between PRD requirements, UX design, and architectural decisions.
